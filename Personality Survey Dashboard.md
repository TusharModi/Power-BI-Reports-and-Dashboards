## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the Personality Survey better understand human attributes. It provides insights into common human traits, such as appearance. It also shows current feelings and personality traits. By using this dashboard, anyone can identify areas for personal growth to lead a more fulfilling life. This dashboard serves as a template, and the datastore can be downloaded from Kaggle. It showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except columns.
- Step 5 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 6 : A new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 7 : One card visual was added to the canvas, representing Personality.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into percentage of gender that how to improve Personality Survey.
           Although, by default, while calculating total respondents, blank values are ignored.
- Step 8 : A donut chart was also added to the report design area representing gender feeling overall.
