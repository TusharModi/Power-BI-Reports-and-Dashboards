## Problem Statement

This dashboard aids Inventory Analysis by providing insights into inventory aging. It tracks key metrics related to fast-moving, slow-moving, and non-moving inventory. By using this dashboard, the Head of Department can identify the total inventory, as well as the number of closed and cancelled jobs. This dashboard serves as a template, and the datastore can be used as a sample for proof of concept. It showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except columns.
- Step 5 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 6 : A new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 7 : Multiple card visual was added to the canvas, representing fast-moving, slow-moving, and non-moving inventory.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into fast-moving, slow-moving, and non-moving inventory that how to improve Inventory Analysis.
           Although, by default, while calculating total respondents, blank values are ignored.
