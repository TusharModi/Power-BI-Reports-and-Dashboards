## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the Productivity Survey better understand human emotions. It provides insights into common distractions for humans, such as social media. It also shows current feelings, productivity challenges, ways to connect with nature, and overall happiness. By using this dashboard, anyone can identify areas for improvement in their lifestyle and work towards a more fulfilling life. This dashboard serves as a template, and the datastore can also be downloaded from Kaggle. It showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except columns.
- Step 5 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 6 : A new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 7 : card visual was added to the canvas, representing Productivity.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into total respondents that how to improve productivity.
           Although, by default, while calculating total respondents, blank values are ignored.
- Step 8 : A bar chart was also added to the report design area representing feeling overall.
